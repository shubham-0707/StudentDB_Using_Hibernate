# StudentDB_Using_Hibernate
- This is basically a simple project.
- In this project I have used Java's ORM Framework i.e. Hibernate using JPA.
- And the data is now stored in Database not in any type of HashMap.
- So we can say that this project is the implementation of ORM Framework i.e. Hibernate.
